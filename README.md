# Experiments with C++

This is a collection of experiments with C++ exploring topics such as
*metaprogramming*, *non-standard containers*.
Most of the code in here should be good for embedded systems, i.e,
no exception, no RTTI, no dynamic memory, no std/boost containers.

The code is currently based on C++17.

### Disclaimer
The code in here has been written based on my personal experiences with C++.
It is therefore possible that snippets of the code in here
will be insipired by clever answers from stack overflow or the like thereof.
No copyright or intellectual property would have been infringed, though,
to the best of my knowledge.
